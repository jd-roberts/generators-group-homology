# generators-group-homology
In the folders above we give a library of finitely-presented groups by presentations, focusing on special linear groups. In addition there is code to find bounds on the second homology of finitely-presented groups and find generators in some cases.

- The special linear group presentation is in Anton, "Homological symbols and the Quillen conjecture" - https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3553.
- The code and some implementations are found in Roberts, "An algorithm for low dimensional group homology" - https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.2610, and "Generators for Group Homology and a Vanishing Conjecture" - https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04069.

For a brief discussin of finitely-presented groups and using them in GAP have a look at [finitely-presented-groups notebook]( https://github.com/jd-roberts/generators-group-homology/blob/main/finitely-presented-groups.ipynb).
