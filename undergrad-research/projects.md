## Calculate spanning sets for the second homology of linear groups with coefficients in a finite field.
- Uses GAP for calculations
- Algebra heavy, topology light
- The items in the table below are vector spaces, and I have upper bounds on the dimension. I want to find explicit spanning sets.

## Topological Data Analysis
- Use topology to analyze the shape of data sets.
- Mostly topology, some algebra.


## Friendly Groups
- The **abundancy** of a positive integer *n* is defined as the sum of the divisors *n* divided by *n*. Two positive integers are called a **friendly pair** if they have the same abundancy. Can we extend this idea to groups? Previous work with an undergraduate defined friendly groups for all finitely-generated abelian groups, but there is lots of work to be done for groups in general. 
- Only algebra, no topology involved.
